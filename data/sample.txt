Q: What is machine learning?
A: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that use statistical methods to identify patterns in data.

Q: What is supervised learning?
A: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data. The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs.

Q: What is unsupervised learning?
A: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data and is tasked with finding hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the data.

Q: What is reinforcement learning?
A: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

Q: What is overfitting in machine learning?
A: Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too closely fitted to the training data, causing it to perform poorly on unseen data. It happens when the model learns noise and random fluctuations in the training data as if they were real patterns.

Q: What is an embedding model?
A: An embedding model is a type of machine learning model that maps input data (such as words or sentences) into continuous vector spaces. These vectors capture semantic meaning, allowing for similarity comparisons.

Q: What is sentence embedding?
A: Sentence embedding is a representation of a sentence in a high-dimensional vector space that captures its semantic meaning, making it easier to compare sentences based on their meanings rather than just word similarity.

Q: How are embeddings used in NLP?
A: In natural language processing (NLP), embeddings are used to represent words, sentences, or documents in a way that allows for semantic comparisons, making it easier to perform tasks like document retrieval, text classification, and semantic search.

Q: What is the difference between word embeddings and sentence embeddings?
A: Word embeddings represent individual words as vectors, while sentence embeddings represent entire sentences. Sentence embeddings capture context and semantics at a higher level, making them useful for tasks like question-answering and document retrieval.

Q: What is TensorFlow?
A: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google that is widely used for developing machine learning models, especially in deep learning. It provides tools for building, training, and deploying models.

A: Pinecone is a fully managed service that handles the infrastructure and scalability for you, while FAISS is a library that requires self-management and setup but provides more control over the indexing process. Pinecone offers an API for seamless integration, whereas FAISS is more developer-centric and customizable.

Q: What is an API?
A: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. APIs are widely used to enable communication between different software services.

Q: What is a REST API?
A: A REST API is an architectural style for building APIs that use HTTP requests to access and manipulate data. It is designed to be stateless and rely on standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
